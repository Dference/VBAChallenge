# VBAChallenge
The VBA Scripting Challenge was to create a script that would loop through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

The Ticker Symbol, Yearly Change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, the Percentage Change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, the Total Stock Volume of the stock, as well as the Greatest % Increase, Greatest % Decrease, and Greatest Total Volume of that years stocks.
